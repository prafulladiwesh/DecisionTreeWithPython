# Introduction:
This implementation is part of an academic programming assignment during Machine Learning Lecture.

# Implementation:
The task is to write a python program to implement decision tree using ID3 algorithm with Information Gain as decision measure and all features as discrete multinomial distributions.

# Input data:
Input data is expected to be a .csv file which will be provided through terminal while running the program

# Output:
Expected output is a xml file which will be created in the same working directory.

# How to Run the program?
Using the following command: 
    python3 decisiontree.py --data somedata.csv --output someoutput.xml
